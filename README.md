# terminal-configuration
**This is Kumar Abhirup's personal terminal configuration**, hosted on GitHub so that he won't have to find and install the same useful plugins everytime he formats/purchases a new laptop.

## Get it working
- To get the configuration working, you first need to download `git`, `zsh`, `oh-my-zsh` and `Zeit HyperTerm 3`.

- Follow the documentation of `oh-my-zsh` and the plugins of `hyperterm` to get the given configuration work correctly.
